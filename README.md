# ORCA-keywords
- `PAL` to run parallel calculation
- `OPT` for optimization
- `TIGHTOPT` or `VERYTIGHTOPT` for tightly optimizing structures
- `FREQ` To calculate vibrational frequencies
- `NUMFREQ` for numerical Hessian calculation
- `LARGEPRINT` to generate orbotal plots
- `AUTOAUX` is used when correlated method can be obtained without special basis set
- `NROOTS`
- `%MAXCORE n` for increasing memory; n is the value of the increase
- `NUMGRAD` is used when you want to optimize the geometry for a method for which no analytical gradient is available. But this takes longer time for calculation.
- `TightPNO` is used for steom calculations
- `TightSCF` for tight convergence
- `DONTO` for plotting NTOs
- `ZORA` including relativistic correlation
